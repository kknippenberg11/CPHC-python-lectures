    "* Interpreted #meaning, in contrast to other languages that are COMPILED (C++, ETC). In an interpreted language, commands are executed IMMEDIATELY by the command interpreter.\n",
    "* Object-oriented\n",
    "  * Data and functions (called \"methods\") are packaged together into OBJECTS. \n",
    "  * An object's methods are used to manipulate that object's data. Can track the data and right there is the code manipulating it. \n",
    "  * Objects are organized into \"classes\", which define the objects' methods & data\n",
    "  * \"Inheritance\" makes it easy to create new classes from existing ones\n",
    "  * Great way to organize your code (and your thinking!)\n",
    "* Modular\n",
    "  * A lot of python's functionality is found in modules\n",
    "  * We need to bring those modules in (import) to use that functionality\n",
    "  * Python comes installed with many modules, many many more can be installed later (Similar to \"packages\" in R)\n",
    "* Leading white space (indentation) is significant\n",
    "  * Level of indentation defines \"blocks\" of code\n",
    "  * Either tabs OR spaces - choose one or the other!\n",

    "# Programming advice\n",
    "* Don't rely on the operating system's python. Its old, and you don't control it.\n",
    "    * At CHPC load a python module, e.g. \"module load python/3.11.3\".\n",
    "    * [Or install your own](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/python-anaconda.php) with micromamba or miniforge.\n",
    "* Use python 3. Python 2 support ended 1/1/2020. https://python-release-cycle.glitch.me/\n",
    "* When editing, save early and save often.\n",
    "* Back your code up with [git](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/git-scm.php) locally, and ideally into a remote software repository.\n",
    "* Write test code, use [assert()](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=assert#the-assert-statement \"Python Docs\"), and learn to use [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "* Learn to use a debugger ([pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/idle.html), [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/debugger.html), [VSCode](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/vscode.php)) - much quicker than print() statements!"
